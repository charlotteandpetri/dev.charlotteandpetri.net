After living 18 years in United States, being married 10+ years to [Charlotte](/charlotte/), we have decided to relocate the entire family to Finland.

The primary reason for our desicion is our son, [Saku](/saku/), who is now 5 years old and will start school soon. While I'm sure Finland has changed a lot within the past 18 years, we feel it is still by far the best choice for him to start school. I believe it is also a much safer environment compared to New Orleans, where somebody gets shot and killed every day (including children).

I know, it is crazy to leave a good job and become a [job hunter](/petri/work/) voluntarily, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make without hesitation.

**Overall, we do have a plan.**
